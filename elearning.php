                        <p>Anterior: toward the front of the body (e.g., toes are anterior to the heel)
                          <br>
                        Posterior: toward the back of the body (e.g., the spine is posterior to the collarbone ‒ or clavicle)
                          <br>
                        Medial: toward the midline of the body (e.g., the arm swing of a baseball player hitting a ball moves medially through the first half of the range of motion)
                          <br>
                        Lateral: away from the midline of the body (e.g., a backhand tennis return moves the arm laterally away from the body)
                          <br>
                        Superficial: toward the surface of the body (e.g., skin is superficial to subcutaneous fat)
                          <br>
                        Deep: inside the body, away from the surface (e.g., the intestines are deep relative to the skin)
                          <br>
                        Adduction (movement): toward the midline of the body (e.g., lowering arms to the legs from a starting position of the arms being extended out to the side)
                          <br>
                        Abduction (movement): away from the midline of the body (e.g., raising arms up to horizontal from a starting position by the side of the legs)
                          <br>
                        Flexion: movement that decreases the angle between body parts (e.g., bending forward at the waist flexes the abdominal muscles)
                          <br>
                        Extension: movement that increases the angle between body parts (e.g., going from a seated position to a standing position extends the knees)
                          <br>
                        Plantar Flexion: increase angle between lower leg and foot (e.g., women who wear high-heeled shoes are in a constant state of plantar flexion)
                          <br>
                        Dorsi Flexion: decrease angle between lower leg and foot (e.g., walking on the heels of the feet results in the feet being dorsiflexed)
                          <br>
                        Elevation: movement in the superior direction (e.g., when shrugging your shoulders, the shoulder blades ‒ or scapulas ‒ elevate)
                          <br>
                        Depression: movement in the inferior direction (e.g., when lowering your shoulders, the scapulas depress)

                        <p>The structure of skeletal muscle can be thought of as a thick cable on a suspension bridge. If you examined the cable that suspends a bridge, you would find that the large cable is made up of many smaller cables that, in turn, are made up of even smaller cables. At the smallest level, each wire strand is woven to make up a single cable that might be less than a millimeter thick. However, after bundling these wires together to create a cable, bundling those cables together to create a larger cable, and repeating this process many times, the resulting cable is able to support the road as well as the traffic.</p>

                        <p>Body movements of runners primarily occur in the sagittal plane (A)  and transverse plane – hips, torso (B). If runners have not trained for movements outside the sagittal plane, when they are forced to move in other planes, the strain on the muscles, ligaments, and tendons often results in soreness at best and injury at worst. While the body does not move much in the frontal plane (C) while running, there is a need to stress the muscles in this plane as many stabilizer muscles are strengthened this way. These stabilizer muscles help to support the primary mover muscles during sagittal plane movements. </p>
